# grails-examples

A repository for things in Grails that I need to see to understand (or about which I want to remember specific details). Currently contains examples for GrailsNameUtils -- a very useful Grails class with some interesting methods for which I've wanted to create some examples for some time. Still a work in progress. 

Currently the examples are a spring boot app. Install the spring boot cli, then run `spring run app.groovy`, and browse to http://localhost:9000 to see the examples. Contributions / edge cases / explanations are welcome. Also making it look nice would be cool too. ;)
