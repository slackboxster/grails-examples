# grails-examples

A repository for things in Grails that I need to see to understand (or about which I want to remember specific details). Currently contains examples for GrailsNameUtils -- a very useful Grails class with some interesting methods for which I've wanted to create some examples for some time. Still a work in progress. 

Currently the examples are a spring boot app. Install the spring boot cli, then run `spring run app.groovy`, and browse to http://localhost:9000 to see the examples. Contributions / edge cases / explanations are welcome. Also making it look nice would be cool too. ;) 

You can also look at a version of the examples in examples.html, but I can't guarantee I'll remember to re-generate that every time I modify something. But at least it is there.

Eventually I will probably turn the whole thing into a script that generates the examples into pages that can run through github pages or something... But to start I need something to run the code, and spring boot is amazing for that purpose. :)
